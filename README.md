> For use with template-pipeline.yml which can be deployed using [Atlantis Configuration Repository for Serverless Deployments using AWS SAM](https://github.com/63Klabs/atlantis-cfn-configuration-repo-for-serverless-deployments)

A very simple example to demonstrate Atlantis Template for AWS CodePipeline to provision a web service that utilizes API Gateway and a simple Lambda function written in Python.

> Note: To keep this example VERY basic and simple, concepts such as routing, caching, and advanced monitoring are not used. For near production-ready examples, review the the other Atlantis starter applications.
